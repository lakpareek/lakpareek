- 👋 Hi, I’m @lakpareek
- 👀 I'm passionate about Fullstack Web Development, specializing in the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). I enjoy building scalable and efficient web applications using this technology stack.
- 🌱 I'm currently expanding my skills in Next.js, Docker, and basic DevOps tools and practices to enhance the development and deployment of robust applications.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects, especially those that involve cutting-edge technologies like CI/CD pipelines, WebSockets, cloud computing, and the PERN stack. I believe in the power of community and am eager to contribute to projects that make a difference.
